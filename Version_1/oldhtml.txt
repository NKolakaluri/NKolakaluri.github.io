            Fitness has been and is a huge part of my life. I spend hours every
            week with some of my closest friends trying to be better than the
            day before. With a structured strength training schedule, strict
            meal plans and discipline I try to reach the physical goals I have
            set for myself.

            After years of studying music theory and practice playing wind
            intruments(clarinet and trumpet), I have decided to try out my first
            string instrument, the electric guitar. The excitement I had when I
            first opened my sunburst stratocaster out of the box was like no
            other. I spend hundreds of hours playing my favorite songs and riffs
            with the guidance of my personal teacher.

            Though it may seem as if I were naturally drawn towards music, there
            was one instrument that initially sparked my interest, the piano. At
            5 years of age, I started playing the piano and had a lot of fun
            playing nursery rhymes such as twinkle twinkle little star. However,
            after a year and a half of playing for hours a day I just found
            myself progressing too slowly and had to drop it. But that wasn't
            the end of it, during quarantine I found myself with a lot of extra
            time, so I decided to pick it up again. With motivation from a
            friend who listens to classical music literally all day, I decided
            to learn some classical pieces and found it to be very enjoyable.

            I've been to DisneyLand 3 times now with the most recent time being
            late August to early September 2022, and it's always a blast. The
            thrill of going on fast rides, seeing many childhood show
            characters, buildings, food, etc. is amazing. My favorite rides of
            them all are Space Mountain, Splash Mountain and the Radiator
            Springs Racers in the California Adventures park.

            Studios during our stay at Disney. Universal Studios has rides that
            are a bit more intense than DisneyLand, but that's what makes them
            fun. My favorite rides in Universal are the Harry Potter Ride, 4D
            Kung fu Panda mini-movie and just because of how good it is I have
            to mention the exclusive drink they have, butterbeer.

            who wanted to participate would go on a boat to this new land.
            During this trip I was surrounded by close friends, experienced new
            foods, saw the awesomeness of the capital building and so much more.
            On top of the already amazing trip I had, our marching band came in
            first place for most spirited.

            painful the scorching heat was. Anyways, my family and I decided to
            go visit some of our closest childhood friends in Seattle who had to
            move to Texas. After seeing them for the first time again in a few
            years it felt as if they never left. During this trip we ate loads
            of food and I experienced my very first outdoor nature pool. This
            pool was definetely the highlight of the trip(besides reuniting with
            my friends) due to how unique of a pool it was. The freezing cold
            water, slimy rocks beneath my feet, vines on the side walls with a
            stunning waterfall made it seem like I was one with nature.

            grandparents, uncles, aunts and the rest of the family. As I was
            very young I can't remember much of the trip, except all of the bad.
            The blazing heat made me sweat pools of water, the amount of people
            around me made it feel hard to move around(kind of claustrophobic)
            and I stubbed my right big toe pretty bad. Nonetheless, it was
            pretty cool to see where my dad grew up, live a different style of
            life than what I was used to and meet more family.
