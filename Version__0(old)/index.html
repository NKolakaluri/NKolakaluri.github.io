            <p>
              Fitness has been and is a huge part of my life. I spend hours
              every week with some of my closest friends trying to be better
              than the day before. With a structured strength training schedule,
              strict meal plans and discipline I try to reach the physical goals
              I have set for myself.

            <p>
              After years of studying music theory and practice playing wind
              intruments(clarinet and trumpet), I have decided to try out my
              first string instrument, the electric guitar. The excitement I had
              when I first opened my sunburst stratocaster out of the box was
              like no other. I spend hundreds of hours playing my favorite songs
              and riffs with the guidance of my personal teacher.

            <p>
              Though it may seem as if I were naturally drawn towards music,
              there was one instrument that initially sparked my interest, the
              piano. At 5 years of age, I started playing the piano and had a
              lot of fun playing nursery rhymes such as twinkle twinkle little
              star. However, after a year and a half of playing for hours a day
              I just found myself progressing too slowly and had to drop it. But
              that wasn't the end of it, during quarantine I found myself with a
              lot of extra time, so I decided to pick it up again. With
              motivation from a friend who listens to classical music literally
              all day, I decided to learn some classical pieces and found it to
              be very enjoyable.

              I've been to DisneyLand 3 times now with the most recent time
              being late August to early September 2022, and it's always a
              blast. The thrill of going on fast rides, seeing many childhood
              show characters, buildings, food, etc. is amazing. My favorite
              rides of them all are Space Mountain, Splash Mountain and the
              Radiator Springs Racers in the California Adventures park.

              My family usually tries to see everything while we are in a new
              place, so it was pretty much a must for us to go check out
              Universal Studios during our stay at Disney. Universal Studios has
              rides that are a bit more intense than DisneyLand, but that's what
              makes them fun. My favorite rides in Universal are the Harry
              Potter Ride, 4D Kung fu Panda mini-movie and just because of how
              good it is I have to mention the exclusive drink they have,
              butterbeer.

              Even though Victoria was less than two hours away from home, it
              was my first time going to another country without my family. This
              trip was organized by my highschool marching band teacher, where
              everyone who wanted to participate would go on a boat to this new
              land. During this trip I was surrounded by close friends,
              experienced new foods, saw the awesomeness of the capital building
              and so much more. On top of the already amazing trip I had, our
              marching band came in first place for most spirited.

            <p>
              Dallas always has a place in me due to the memories I made as a
              child growing up there. Although the main memory I have is how
              painful the scorching heat was. Anyways, my family and I decided
              to go visit some of our closest childhood friends in Seattle who
              had to move to Texas. After seeing them for the first time again
              in a few years it felt as if they never left. During this trip we
              ate loads of food and I experienced my very first outdoor nature
              pool. This pool was definetely the highlight of the trip(besides
              reuniting with my friends) due to how unique of a pool it was. The
              freezing cold water, slimy rocks beneath my feet, vines on the
              side walls with a stunning waterfall made it seem like I was one
              with nature.

            <p>
              The first country I visited. At 5 years of age my family decided
              it was time to head to India to meet my grandparents, great
              grandparents, uncles, aunts and the rest of the family. As I was
              very young I can't remember much of the trip, except all of the
              bad. The blazing heat made me sweat pools of water, the amount of
              people around me made it feel hard to move around(kind of
              claustrophobic) and I stubbed my right big toe pretty bad.
              Nonetheless, it was pretty cool to see where my dad grew up, live
              a different style of life than what I was used to and meet more
              family.
