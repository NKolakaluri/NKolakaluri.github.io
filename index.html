        <h2>Fitness</h2>
        <p>
          Fitness has been and is a huge part of my life. I spend hours every
          week with some of my closest friends trying to be better than the day
          before. With a structured strength training schedule, strict meal
          plans and discipline I try to reach the physical goals I have set for
          myself.

        <p>
          After years of studying music theory and practice playing wind
          intruments(clarinet and trumpet), I have decided to try out my first
          string instrument, the electric guitar. The excitement I had when I
          first opened my sunburst stratocaster out of the box was like no
          other. I spend hundreds of hours playing my favorite songs and riffs
          with the guidance of my personal teacher.

          Though it may seem as if I were naturally drawn towards music, there
          was one instrument that initially sparked my interest, the piano. At 5
          years of age, I started playing the piano and had a lot of fun playing
          nursery rhymes such as twinkle twinkle little star. However, after a
          year and a half of playing for hours a day I just found myself
          progressing too slowly and had to drop it. But that wasn't the end of
          it, during quarantine I found myself with a lot of extra time, so I
          decided to pick it up again. With motivation from a friend who listens
          to classical music literally all day, I decided to learn some
          classical pieces and found it to be very enjoyable.

        <h2>DisneyLand California</h2>
        <p>Visited: Aug 29, 2022 - Sep 3, 2022</p>
        <p>
          I've been to DisneyLand 3 times now with the most recent time being
          late August to early September 2022, and it's always a blast. The
          thrill of going on fast rides, seeing many childhood show characters,
          buildings, food, etc. is amazing. My favorite rides of them all are
          Space Mountain, Splash Mountain and the Radiator Springs Racers in the
          California Adventures park.

        <p>
          My family usually tries to see everything while we are in a new place,
          so it was pretty much a must for us to go check out Universal Studios
          during our stay at Disney. Universal Studios has rides that are a bit
          more intense than DisneyLand, but that's what makes them fun. My
          favorite rides in Universal are the Harry Potter Ride, Kung fu Panda
          mini-movie(not sure if its called that HAHALMAO) and just because of
          how good it is I have to mention the exclusive drink they have,
          butterbeer.

        <p>
          Even though Victoria was less than two hours away from home, it was my
          first time going to another country without my family. This trip was
          organized by my highschool marching band teacher, where everyone who
          wanted to participate would go on a boat to this new land. During this
          trip I was surrounded by close friends, experienced new foods, saw the
          outstandingness(maybe a word??)of the capital building and so much
          more. On top of the already amazing trip I had, our marching band came
          in first place for most spirited.

        <h2>Dallas Texas</h2>
        <p>Visited: Aug 8, 2016 - Aug 15, 2016</p>
        <p>
          Dallas has always had a place in me due to the memories I had as a
          child growing up there(DO SUM, TO THIS). Although the main memory I
          have is how painful the scorching heat was. Anyways, my family and I
          decided to go visit some of our closest childhood friends in Seattle
          who had to move to Texas. After seeing them for the first time again
          in a few years it felt as if they never left. During this trip we ate
          loads of food and I experienced my very first outdoor nature pool.
          This pool was definetely the highlight of the trip(besides reuniting
          with my friends) due to how unique of a pool it was. The freezing cold
          water, slimy rocks beneath my feet, vines on the side walls with a
          stunning waterfall made it seem like I was one with nature.
